## Abstract

Abstract Despite rapid progress in LLM agents, performance on long-horizon, tool-using tasks remains fragile. To better understand this fragility, we ask a simple question: do all actions contribute equally to failure? Analyzing execution traces on τ \tau -Bench (Airline/Retail) and SWE-Bench Verified, we decompose trajectories into mutating (environment-changing) vs. non-mutating steps and formalize decisive deviations —earliest action-level divergences that flip success to failure. A logistic regression reveals that each additional deviation in a mutating action reduces the odds of success by upto 92 % 92\% on Airline and upto 96 % 96\% on Retail for SoTA models. In contrast, deviations in non-mutating actions have little to no effect.
Errors also grow with context length as agents drift from role and act on stale constraints. Motivated by these observations, we introduce SABER, a model-agnostic, gradient-free, test-time safeguard that (i) adds mutation-gated verification, (ii) injects Targeted Reflection before mutating steps, and (iii) performs block-based context cleaning. SABER delivers consistent gains—e.g., Qwen3-Thinking: +28% relative on Airline, +11% on Retail, and +7% on SWE-Bench Verified; Claude: +9%/+7%. We further identify ceiling effects in τ \tau -Bench, where annotation errors and underspecified tasks artificially cap model performance. To address this, we release τ \tau -Bench Verified, which restores benchmark headroom through targeted revisions.
Our results argue for action-level analysis, targeted safeguards, and reliable evaluations as prerequisites for robust multi-turn agents.

## 1 Introduction

Real-world, long-horizon tasks—whether in enterprise operations, software engineering, scientific analysis, or multi-step information retrieval—demand language agents that can plan, invoke tools, and maintain coordinated behavior across many turns . Despite impressive single-step capabilities, today’s leading agents are brittle in extended interactions: they misinterpret constraints, rely on stale context, and issue tool calls that derail progress . Current frameworks typically treat all decision steps uniformly—end-to-end prompting, generic scoring, and whole-trajectory reruns all assume the same level of scrutiny across actions . Recent analyses catalog broad behavioral failures , but rarely pinpoint the specific decision steps where success flips to failure. Our study begins with a simple question: *Do all actions contribute equally to task failure?*

Figure: Figure 1: Illustration of Targeted Reflection and Mutation-Gated User Verification
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.07850/x1.png

We answer this by analyzing execution traces of strong open- and closed-weight models on $\tau$-Bench (Section 3). Partitioning the action space into *mutating* (state-changing such as cancelling a booking, issuing a refund, deleting a file) and *non-mutating* (information-gathering) steps, we show by fitting a regression model that deviations in mutating actions are the decisive predictors of failure, with each additional deviation in the number of mutating actions reducing the odds of success by $55\%\sim 92\%$ on the Airline subset and $87\%\sim 96\%$ on the Retail subset (all $p<0.001$), respectively, for three different models including Qwen3-Thinking-235B, GPT-5 and Claude-4-Sonnet. Meanwhile, deviations in non-mutating steps have little effect: always below 10% success ratio reduction per non-mutating deviation on both Airline and Retail subsets, with non-significant $p$-values on some cases (details in Table 1). In short, failures cluster at a small slice of mutating steps, revealing a disproportionately risky subset of the decision space.

However, efficiency at the mutating gate alone is not enough, because errors grow more frequent as context length increases. Agents progressively lose fidelity to their intended role and policies due to “lost-in-the-middle” effects and the over-trust of stale tokens . Even trajectories that begin correctly can drift, leading to misaligned or outdated tool calls at later mutating steps . To sustain reliability in long-horizon settings, we propose two additional mechanisms: lightweight reminders that sharpen constraints before risky steps, and context cleaning that keeps verification-critical history salient. Together, these measures aim to preserve alignment while keeping intervention selective rather than overwhelming.

Yet drawing such conclusions requires trust in the benchmark itself. We found that $\tau$-Bench, though widely adopted, embeds inconsistencies and underspecified instructions that cap attainable performance and blur differences between models. For example, Airline tasks contain contradictory booking policies, and Retail tasks often omit disambiguation (e.g., “pay with the credit card” despite multiple cards on file). To support rigorous evaluation, we re-audit both domains, correcting annotation errors and clarifying policies. We release the result as $\tau$-Bench Verified, a cleaned version that preserves task coverage while removing systemic flaws. On this stronger foundation, differences between strong models re-emerge and the benefits of safeguards become clearer, as shown by the consistent gains in Table 2.

Building on this foundation, we propose SABER, a model-agnostic, gradient-free safeguard that combines three mechanisms: *Mutation-Gated User Verification* to place decisive steps under direct scrutiny, *Targeted Reflection* to counter “lost-in-the-middle” drift, and *Block-based Context Cleaning* to prevent stale confirmations from crowding and to keep only verification-critical and goal-salient history. We illustrate *Mutation-Gated User Verification* and *Targeted Reflection* in Figure 1, while we detail *Block-based Context Cleaning* in Section 4.

We evaluate SABER across open and closed models, pairing main models with auxiliary models: the main model generates actions, while the auxiliary model provides reflection, verification, and context cleaning. Across $\tau$-Bench Verified and SWE-Bench Verified, SABER consistently yields substantial improvements. For example, Qwen3-Thinking-235B paired with a Qwen3-Instruct-235B auxiliary improves 19.7% on Airline Verified, 10.8% on Retail Verified and 7% on SWE-Bench Verified, while both GPT-5 and Claude 4 gain further headroom once benchmark flaws are removed. These results highlight not only the importance of focusing oversight on mutating steps but also the broader need for refined evaluation to reveal genuine differences in model robustness.

## 2 Related Work

#### Agency in AI systems.

While classical AI defined agents broadly as entities that perceive and act on their environment , recent work views agency as a spectrum of capabilities , emphasizing autonomous goal pursuit, natural language interaction, and structured tool use . This perspective has driven the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating LLM capabilities in real-world scenarios , as well as systems that combine prompt engineering and context engineering techniques to improve agent reliability . In contrast to prior work that focuses on building new systems to enhance performance, we analyze execution trajectories of existing state-of-the-art models to ask a fundamental question: Do all actions contribute equally to task failure? Our analysis shows that small flaws in *mutable actions* (Section 3) disproportionately drive failures. Leveraging this insight, we develop SABER, the first system that combines enhanced reflection and selective human-agent collaboration to intervene only when supervision is truly necessary.

#### Multi-agent systems.

Another line of research explores using LLMs as central controllers for agents that interact with external environments beyond text-only domains . Recent work investigates multi-agent systems where multiple specialized agents interact concurrently , enabling collaboration for complex tasks. Although promising, such systems are often costly, prone to compounding errors, and have not demonstrated consistent gains on standard benchmarks . By contrast, our approach is gradient-free and single-agent, focusing on reducing critical mistakes. Specifically, SABER integrates an enhanced reflection mechanism and explicitly identifies irreversible actions that humans can approve before their execution.

#### User simulators for enhancing AI systems.

A growing body of work explores LLMs as simulators of human characters, ranging from non-player characters in games to agents embedded in human-like societies or collaborative task settings . These efforts demonstrate that LLMs can emulate realistic human interaction patterns, but they have primarily been used for showcasing simulation rather than improving agent reliability. In our work, user simulators play a different role: they provide a scalable way to approximate the human confirmation step required by SABER. Instead of relying on human evaluators, benchmarks such as $\tau$-Bench offer simulated users that allow us to evaluate how SABER integrates human-in-the-loop feedback. This enables us to systematically test how selective confirmation of irreversible actions reduces decisive errors, while preserving efficiency in real-world scenarios.

#### Benchmarks for agent evaluation.

A variety of benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate language agents, yet important limitations remain. Stable ToolBench  mitigates instability from external APIs through a virtual server, but relies on large models for evaluation, leading to high costs and limited scalability. BFCL  and HammerBench  extend evaluation to multi-turn dialogues, but their trajectories are constructed from pre-defined content and fail to capture under-specified or evolving real-world user goals. $\tau$-Bench  and $\tau^{2}$-Bench moves closer to realistic evaluation by embedding agents in domain-specific environments with simulated users. However, as we show in Section 5, annotation errors and under-specified instructions cap achievable performance, weakening its diagnostic reliability. We address this gap by releasing $\tau$-Bench Verified, a fully revised version of the Airline and Retail domains that corrects dataset inconsistencies and resolves ambiguities. This benchmark provides a more faithful and trustworthy measure of agent capabilities, enabling robust evaluation of SABER and future systems.

## 3 Problem Formulation

We introduce a formal framework to analyze decisive errors in LLM-powered agentic systems, distinguishing between environment-mutating and non-mutating actions within a standard turn-based protocol .

#### Background.

Consider an LLM-powered single-agent system $\mathcal{M}$ that operates at discrete time steps. At each step, the agent observes the current state and performs exactly one action. Formally,

$$ $\mathcal{M}=\langle S,A,P\rangle.$ $$

Here, $S$ is the set of states, $A$ the action set, and $P(s_{t+1}\mid s_{t},a_{t})$ the transition law. A trajectory is $\tau=(s_{0},a_{0},s_{1},a_{1},\dots,s_{T})$, and failure-indicator $Z(\tau)\in\{0,1\}$ denotes failure (1) or success (0).

#### Decisive deviation (comparative).

Let $\tau^{\star}$ be a successful reference trajectory for a task ($Z(\tau^{\star})=0$; see Section 5). Let $\tau^{\prime}$ be a candidate trajectory for the same task, and let $t$ be the earliest index at which their action sequences diverge (prefixes up to $t\!-\!1$ match). Denote by $\tilde{a}_{t}$ the additional action appearing at position $t$ in $\tau^{\prime}$ (relative to $\tau^{\star}$). Define the decisive-deviation indicator

$$ $\Delta_{t}^{+}(\tau^{\prime},\tau^{\star})=\begin{cases}1,&\text{if }Z(\tau^{\star})=0\text{ and }Z(\tau^{\prime})=1,\\ 0,&\text{otherwise}.\end{cases}$ $$

Thus, $\Delta_{t}^{+}=1$ captures that introducing the $\tilde{a}_{t}$ at step at $t$ flips a success into a failure.

#### Mutating vs. non-mutating insertions.

Partition the action set into mutating and non-mutating subsets: $A^{\mathrm{mut}}\subseteq A$ (actions that change the external environment or user-visible state) and $A^{\mathrm{non}}=A\setminus A^{\mathrm{mut}}$. Our working hypothesis is that decisive flips arise predominantly from *mutating* insertions:

$$ $\,\mathbb{P}(\Delta^{+}_{t}=1\mid\tilde{a}_{t}\!\in\!A^{\mathrm{mut}})\gg\mathbb{P}(\Delta^{+}_{t}=1\mid\tilde{a}_{t}\!\in\!A^{\mathrm{non}})$ $$

#### From local deviations to a dataset-level test.

To connect Eq. 3 and Eq. 3 to corpus-level evidence, we audit trajectories via deviations from the reference plan. Let

$$ $M(\tau)=\sum_{k}\mathbf{1}[a_{k}\in A^{\mathrm{mut}}],\qquad N(\tau)=\sum_{k}\mathbf{1}[a_{k}\in A^{\mathrm{non}}],$ $$

and define absolute deviations

$$ $d_{\mathrm{mut}}(\tau^{\prime};\tau^{\star})=\big|M(\tau^{\prime})-M(\tau^{\star})\big|,\qquad d_{\mathrm{non}}(\tau^{\prime};\tau^{\star})=\big|N(\tau^{\prime})-N(\tau^{\star})\big|.$ $$

Under Eq. equation 3, success should decrease primarily with $d_{\mathrm{mut}}$ after controlling for $d_{\mathrm{non}}$.
For example, overshooting by one extra file deletion (*mutating*) is far more likely to cause failure than adding one redundant search query (*non-mutating*).

**Table 1: Logistic regression of task success on mutating and non-mutating distance across models and datasets. Mutating deviations dominate task failure across models and datasets, while non-mutating deviations have inconsistent or negligible effects. ”med” indicates medium reasoning effort.**
| Model | Dataset | Mutating distance | Non-mutating distance | n |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Coef. | OR | p | Coef. | OR | p |  |  |  |
| GPT-5 (med) | $\tau$-Bench Retail | -1.06 | 0.35 | $<0.001$ | -0.01 | 0.99 | 0.781 | 690 |
| GPT-5 (med) | $\tau$-Bench Airline | -2.02 | 0.13 | $<0.001$ | -0.04 | 0.96 | 0.163 | 297 |
| Qwen3-Thinking | $\tau$-Bench Retail | -0.80 | 0.45 | $<0.001$ | -0.02 | 0.98 | 0.559 | 345 |
| Qwen3-Thinking | $\tau$-Bench Airline | -2.46 | 0.09 | $<0.001$ | -0.12 | 0.89 | 0.004 | 297 |
| Claude Sonnet 4.0 | $\tau$-Bench Retail | -2.54 | 0.08 | $<0.001$ | -0.09 | 0.91 | 0.008 | 690 |
| Claude Sonnet 4.0 | $\tau$-Bench Airline | -3.32 | 0.04 | $<0.001$ | -0.21 | 0.81 | $<0.001$ | 297 |

A logistic regression shows that *mutating deviations* are the primary driver of failure, while *non-mutating deviations* matter far less (Table 1). An odds ratio (OR) below $1$ means each extra mismatch reduces success; for instance, in $\tau$-Bench Airline with Claude 4, a mutating mismatch cuts the odds of success by $96\%$ (OR $=0.04$), compared to only $19\%$ for a non-mutating mismatch (OR $=0.81$). Across models, mutating deviations consistently yield large, significant penalties, confirming our hypothesis (Eq. 3) that failures stem mainly from errors in mutating steps. Our objective is therefore to reduce decisive deviations, $\Pr[\Delta_{t}^{+}=1]$, by detecting when actions lie in $A^{\mathrm{mut}}$ and checking them against task constraints (system rules, tool schemas, and user requirements; Fig. 1 (a). Safeguards applied only at these high-risk points minimize overhead while directly targeting the main source of failure. The next section introduces SABER, which operationalizes this strategy.

## 4 SABER : Safeguarding Against Mutating Actions

As shown by the unguarded failure in Fig. 1(a) and the dataset trends in Table 1, decisive deviations cluster at *mutating* steps. These actions account for only 14–18% of total steps (e.g., Qwen3–Airline: 15.5%, Qwen3–Retail: 18.3%) yet dominate failure risk: a single mutating deviation reduces success odds drastically, whereas non-mutating deviations are nearly harmless (Table 1). To safeguard against this failure mode without overwhelming the user, we introduce SABER, a lightweight, model-agnostic context management system that plugs into existing agent loops without retraining.

### 4.1 Safeguards for Mutating Actions

Mutation-gated human verification.
SABER requires explicit user confirmation *only before executing mutating actions*, capping interruptions to roughly one in six turns. Non-mutating actions proceed autonomously. This focused scrutiny concentrates scarce user attention on the steps most likely to flip success into failure, reducing decisive errors while keeping verification burden low; cf. Fig. 1 (c). In practice, this gating also prevents prompt-locking or stalling attacks, since the next post-feedback action is executed directly.

Targeted reflection.
In long trajectories, mutating actions $a_{t}\in A^{\mathrm{mut}}$ often produce tool calls that are syntactically valid but semantically inconsistent with system constraints, due to “lost in the middle” effects . To counteract this, SABER injects a concise, high-salience summary of key instructions *at the point of mutation*. This reduces miscalibrated tool calls and improves alignment (illustrated in Fig. 1 (b)). When reasoning traces are unsupported, the same summary is appended in a ReAct-style format to preserve guidance.

Block-based context filtering.
Verification turns can inflate dialogue history and cause *context poisoning* , as shown by the growth of confirmation turns in Fig. 1 (c). SABER therefore partitions trajectories into blocks, summarizes them, and retrieves only the most relevant blocks for the current user query. This keeps the effective context compact and pertinent, mitigating poisoning while preserving the benefits of verification. The retrieval budget $N$ is user-configurable to trade off recall and context-window pressure.

### 4.2 SABER System Implementation

To operationalize these safeguards, SABER defines two cooperating models: a *main model*, responsible for generating actions, and an *auxiliary model*, responsible for verification, reflection, and context management. This separation keeps the main policy unchanged while allowing the auxiliary to enforce gates and maintain context cheaply.

Figure: Figure 2: Runtime workflow of SABER. The pipeline is anchored on *mutation-gated human verification*: the auxiliary model inspects whether a candidate action $a_{t}$ is mutating and, if so, reformulates the tool call into natural language and requests user confirmation. To support this gate in long contexts, the auxiliary model (i) injects a distilled reflection of system instructions and tool constraints into a <think> block to reduce invalid mutations, and (ii) applies block-based context filtering to retain only verification-critical and goal-salient history.
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2512.07850/x2.png

For each candidate action $a_{t}$, the auxiliary model checks whether it is mutating. If so, it reformulates the tool call into a concise natural-language summary with essential preconditions and intended effects, and requests user confirmation. The user’s feedback is incorporated into the trajectory ($\tau^{\prime}$), after which the main model produces its next action—executing the tool call if confirmed or revising if rejected. Non-mutating actions bypass verification entirely. To minimize semantically invalid mutations, the auxiliary model injects a distilled reflection of constraints into a <think> block (or a ReAct-style format  when reasoning traces are unsupported). Finally, to counteract context poisoning, the auxiliary model stores block-level summaries $(s_{k},e_{k})$ and retrieves the $N$ most relevant blocks by embedding similarity to the latest user query. This block-based filtering retains only verification-critical history, mitigating drift without exceeding context limits. In our implementation, embeddings are cached and summaries are short, so the added latency is marginal relative to typical tool calls.

Taken together, mutation-gated verification, targeted reflection, and block-based filtering deliver a narrow, high-yield intervention surface: most turns remain fully autonomous, while the few high-risk mutating steps receive concise guidance and a single confirmation hop, enabling strong accuracy gains with minimal overhead.

## 5 Tau-Bench Verified

$\tau$-Bench  is a recently introduced benchmark for evaluating LLM-based agents in realistic interactive environments. It provides domain-specific scenarios (e.g., airline booking, retail shopping) where an agent must complete tasks through multi-turn tool calls while interacting with a simulated user.
While valuable for assessing environment interaction, we identified systematic issues in the released datasets that significantly limit achievable performance.

Figure: Figure 3: Two examples of incorrect ground-truth annotations in $\tau$-Bench. (a) In Retail, the solution reuses the same product ID, violating the policy that exchanges require a different option. (b) In Airline, the solution issues a certificate without first confirming and changing/cancelling the reservation.

### 5.1 Existing Issues in τ \tau -Bench

In the Airline domain, dataset inconsistencies capped performance at roughly 70%, while in the Retail domain, annotation errors limited performance to around 92%.
This is concerning given the widespread use of $\tau$-Bench to evaluate agentic capabilities of state-of-the-art models .
Moreover, these problems persist even in the recently released $\tau^{2}$-Bench as these domains haven’t been updated . We showcase two representative examples from each domain in Figure 3, a complete set of the ground truth problems can be found in the Appendix C.

### 5.2 Under-specified user instructions.

Beyond ground truth errors, we found that many instructions in the original datasets are under-specified.
For instance, in the Airline and Retail domains, 31 out of 50 and 53 out of 115 instructions, respectively, lacked sufficient detail (e.g., a user is asked to pay with “the credit card” despite having two cards on file, but the benchmark accepts only one).
Such ambiguities increase benchmark variance and weaken its reliability as a diagnostic tool.
While $\tau^{2}$-Bench acknowledges this issue and introduces a new Telecom domain, it does not resolve the problems in the original Airline or Retail domains.

### 5.3 τ \tau -Bench Verified.

To address these shortcomings, we manually reviewed every task, corrected errors, extended user instructions and compiled the revised benchmark, which we term $\tau$-Bench Verified.
The full list of corrections is included in the Appendix, and we highlight two representative cases in the main text—one from Airline and one from Retail—where annotation issues directly prevented correct model solutions.
We release $\tau$-Bench Verified publicly to provide a more faithful benchmark for assessing LLM agent capabilities and to encourage more robust evaluation practices in future work.

## 6 Experiments

This section is organized as follows. In Section 6.1, we demonstrate how SABER can enhance the performance of existing models on agentic tasks, such as those in the SWE-bench Verified, Tau-Bench Airline or Tau-Bench Retail benchmark. In Section 5, we conduct a detailed analysis of Tau-Bench Airline and Retail test dataset correctness and propose Tau-Bench Verified.

### 6.1 SABER improves performance in agentic tasks

We observe that every trajectory across benchmarks requires for success one or more mutating actions that can trigger a decisive error (as shown in Eq 3).
These mutating actions are necessary for task completion but present an inherent risk. To address this, we apply SABER to improve model performance.

**Table 2: Performance of different models on $\tau$-Bench variants and SWE-Bench Verified, with and without SABER. In the table, ”V” stands for verified. To reduce the variance present in $\tau$-Bench, we report the average score over three runs. All evaluations are limited to 30 turns.**

Models.
SABER is gradient-free and prompt-only, so it applies directly to both closed- and open-weight LLMs. We evaluate
claude-sonnet-4-20250514 and gpt-5-2025-08-07 (medium reasoning) as closed-source models, and
Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 as an open-weight model. Unless otherwise noted, each model serves as both the
main agent (actioning) and the auxiliary agent (judge/summarizer) within SABER. For Qwen3, we report
two auxiliary variants paired with the Thinking main: Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 and
Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507. All models are evaluated on $\tau$-Bench and $\tau$-Bench-Verified (Airline and
Retail; see Section 5); additionally, due to the inherent cost of evaluating closed-source models we only evaluate Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 on SWE-Bench
Verified. We use claude-sonnet-4-20250514 as a simulated user in $\tau$-Bench.

Baselines and protocol.
We compare each model (and pairing) *with* and *without* SABER. The no-SABER baseline uses each benchmark’s
standard native tool-calling setup, following prior reports for $\tau$-Bench .
For SWE-Bench Verified, we use OpenHands as the tool-calling framework .
To keep budgets comparable, we cap each episode at 30 turns on every benchmark. We also perform ablations on
$\tau$-Bench-Verified (Airline/Retail) using Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 as the main model to isolate the
contribution of each SABER component: (i) remove reflection, (ii) remove mutation-gated verification, and
(iii) remove context control. We report both *same-model* pairings (main = auxiliary) and *within-family*
mixed pairings to assess sensitivity to the auxiliary model.

We make the following observations:

- •
Mutating actions are relatively rare.
Across Airline and Retail, they account for only $\approx 14\text{–}18\%$ of all steps
(e.g., Qwen3–Airline: 15.5%, Claude-4–Retail: 18.1%). This skew means that most of the
trajectory proceeds through non-mutating actions, keeping the space of potential interventions
small.
- •
But when they occur, they carry outsized risk.
A single mutating deviation reduces success odds by 57–82%, while a comparable non-mutating
deviation reduces odds by only 7–15% (Table 1). SABER therefore
targets verification precisely at these mutating points, minimizing user burden—most steps
remain autonomous—while still neutralizing the majority of decisive errors.
- •
Large and consistent improvements.
Across both Airline and Retail domains, SABER delivers double-digit gains for the most failure-prone model: Qwen3-Thinking improves by +14.0 pp on Airline (49.3% → 63.3%) and +7.3 pp on Retail (64.3% → 71.6%). Gains also extend to verified settings, with +19.7 pp on $\tau$-Bench-V Air (58.5% → 78.2%) and +10.8 pp on $\tau$-Bench-V Ret (66.9% → 77.7%). More capable baselines still benefit: ChatGPT-5 rises by +17.3 pp on Airline and +3.1 pp on Retail, while Claude Sonnet 4 gains +4.7 pp and +5.0 pp respectively. These consistent lifts across models and datasets (Table 2) show that SABER improves weaker and stronger systems alike.
- •
Synergy of reflection and verification. Ablations (Table 3) show that reflection and verification each add $\sim$10 pp in Airline, but together yield the strongest gains (78.7%). This supports our hypothesis: mutating steps require both constraint reminders and user oversight. In Retail, both mechanisms surpass 80% individually, and combined hover around the same score, potentially due to benchmark saturation.
- •
Verified benchmarks expose hidden headroom.
Gains are consistently larger on $\tau$-Bench Verified than on the original: for instance, Claude Sonnet 4 jumps +8.2 pp on $\tau$-Bench-V Air versus +4.7 pp on Airline (Table 2). Correcting dataset noise thus reveals genuine capacity improvements that standard benchmarks understate.
- •
SWE-Bench constraints. On SWE-Bench Verified, where only the enhanced reflection can be applied, SABER still improves Qwen3-Thinking by about 4 pp, confirming that even partial safeguards matter.
- •
Auxiliary–main pairing matters.
The choice of auxiliary model significantly affects outcomes. Using Qwen3-Thinking as the auxiliary yields only a +10 pp gain on $\tau$-Bench-Verified Airline, while pairing the reasoning-focused Qwen3-Thinking main with the instruction-tuned Qwen3-Instruct auxiliary produces much larger improvements (Table 2). Systematically exploring which models best complement each other is an open direction that we leave for future work.

**Table 3: Ablation study of SABER on Qwen3-Thinking-235B for $\tau$-Bench Verified Airline and Retail. Columns activate different safeguards: *Reflection*, *Mutation-gated user verification*, and their combination in *Full SABER*. In all settings, *Block-based context cleaning* is applied with the number of blocks capped at 16 (see Section 4.2).**
| Benchmark | No-SABER | +Reflection | +Verification | Full SABER |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $\tau$-Bench Verified Airline | 58.0% | 68.0% | 68.7% | 78.7% |
| $\tau$-Bench Verified Retail | 66.9% | 80.8% | 80.5% | 77.7% |

The improvements support our formal analysis: decisive deviations are driven primarily by mutating actions (Eq. 3). By gating these actions through simulated user verification and reducing invalid insertions via reflection, SABER lowers the probability that a deviation at step $t$ flips a successful trajectory $\tau^{\star}$ into a failing one $\tau^{\prime}$ (Eq. 3), thereby improving overall task success.

## 7 Conclusion

This work shows that not all actions are equally risky in long-horizon agent executions: a small slice of *mutating* steps accounts for a disproportionate share of decisive failures. We formalized this with a decisive-deviation test, validated the *mutating-dominates* hypothesis at the dataset level, and re-audited $\tau$-Bench to produce $\tau$-Bench Verified, a cleaner yardstick that exposes genuine headroom.

Building on these findings, we introduced SABER, a model-agnostic, gradient-free safeguard that focuses intervention where it pays off most: *mutation-gated user verification* at risky steps, *targeted reflection* to keep tool calls semantically consistent with constraints, and *block-based context cleaning* to keep verification-critical history salient.

Empirically, SABER delivers consistent gains across models and domains on $\tau$-Bench and $\tau$-Bench Verified (Table 2). SABER demonstrates that not all actions need equal scrutiny: focusing safeguards on rare but decisive mutating steps yields outsized reliability improvements; gating *only* these steps concentrates user attention while leaving most turns autonomous.

## 8 Limitations

SABER is introduced as an online safeguard rather than a training-time property.
While mutation-gated verification and targeted reflection reduce decisive errors at test time, they are externally imposed.
Future training regimes could internalize these behaviors—for example, by shaping loss functions around decisive deviations or teaching models to self-identify mutating actions—so that models regulate risky steps without auxiliary intervention.
This would reduce reliance on auxiliary mechanisms and make the safeguards part of the model’s native reasoning process.

A second limitation is that SABER depends on access to a user or user simulator for confirming irreversible actions.
This assumption matches real-world deployments, but few benchmarks natively support user-in-the-loop verification.
Simulated users help approximate the setting, yet they inevitably simplify the variability of human feedback.
Expanding benchmark design to include confirmation and reflection episodes is therefore essential for evaluating and advancing practical safeguards, and for ensuring that improvements transfer reliably to real users.

## Appendix A Broader Impacts

This work advances the reliability of LLM-powered agents by identifying and mitigating errors concentrated at mutating actions. By introducing lightweight safeguards that require human confirmation only at high-risk points, our approach reduces failure rates without imposing excessive user burden. This makes agentic systems safer and more predictable for deployment in real-world domains such as software engineering, operations, and customer support. More broadly, selective oversight helps prevent costly or harmful unintended changes, thereby supporting responsible adoption of LLM agents while keeping human involvement efficient and focused.

## Appendix B Reproducibility Statement.

We release an anonymous repository with code, data, and instructions to fully reproduce our results: [https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SABER-1E54/](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SABER-1E54/). The repository contains (i) the SABER implementation and configuration used in all experiments (Section 4); (ii) the corrected $\tau$-Bench Verified datasets (Airline/Retail), along with scripts and diffs documenting each fix (Section 5, Appendix A); (iii) experiment drivers, prompts, and evaluation pipelines for all models and settings reported (Section 6.1); (iv) scripts to regenerate figures and tables, including the logistic-regression analyses in Table 1.

## Appendix C Appendix: Corrections to τ \tau -Bench–Airline

We audited the Airline split and found several tasks whose *action traces* (or their parameters / allowed paths) violated the official Wiki policy. For each task below, we (i) restate the governing rule, (ii) show the *previous* (incorrect) ground truth action(s) from the original dataset, (iii) show the *correct* action(s) after our fix (only actions are shown; instruction-only edits are excluded), and (iv) explain the error and the fix in detail.

Legend. We reference the Airline Wiki sections: *Book flight*, *Modify flight*, *Cancel flight*, *Refund*, baggage allowances, and single-call constraints (one tool call *or* a user reply at a time).

### Task 1 — payment method alignment (gift card choice)

#### Why it is wrong.

The chosen gift card ID did not reflect the user’s stated order (use the smallest-balance card first), violating payment preferences under the policy.

#### Fix explanation.

Swap to the correct gift card consistent with the instruction and payment constraints; keep add-only baggage semantics unchanged.

### Task 2 — encode multiple compliant sequences (valid_action_paths)

#### Why it is wrong.

Only one sequence was accepted even though multiple policy-compliant orders exist; this unfairly penalizes correct agent behavior that follows a different but valid order.

#### Fix explanation.

Replace the single sequence with valid_action_paths enumerating all compliant permutations that (i) upgrade to economy if needed, (ii) set passenger to self, (iii) add 3 bags, and (iv) use the specified gift card.

### Task 3 — flight numbers/day-after rule

#### Why it is wrong.

Any deviation in flight numbers or an incorrect date shift breaks the user’s explicit “next-day” directive.

#### Fix explanation.

Lock numbers; move them exactly one day later; keep cabin unchanged and a single refund/payment method per policy.

### Task 4 — cancel+rebook path and baggage enumeration

#### Why it is wrong.

Only one baggage outcome was hard-coded. The Wiki allows add-only baggage and real agents may result in different (still valid) totals. Penalizing those paths is incorrect.

#### Fix explanation.

Encode the shared cancel+book logic but enumerate the allowed baggage totals via valid_action_paths, preserving payment order and limits.

### Task 5 — passenger mapping for multi-certificate workaround

#### Why it is wrong.

The split-reservation trick must preserve correct passenger identities per instruction; mislabeling breaks both user intent and safety checks.

#### Fix explanation.

Rename affected passengers to Raj and Liam to match the instruction while keeping single-certificate-per-PNR semantics.

### Task 6 — avoid premature cancellation

#### Why it is wrong.

Auto-cancel violates the Wiki’s cancellation prerequisites and removes the user’s chance to accept a modification-first solution.

#### Fix explanation.

Remove auto-cancel from the gold trace; agents must first attempt removal or present options, then cancel only with eligibility and explicit confirmation.

### Task 7 — encode acceptable outcomes (bags 0 vs 3)

#### Why it is wrong.

The dataset disallowed another equally valid end-state (3 free bags), unfairly penalizing compliant agents.

#### Fix explanation.

Adopt valid_action_paths to encode both allowed baggage totals without changing passenger/payment correctness.

### Task 8 — remove unrelated searches/calculations

#### Why it is wrong.

The search/calculation calls are unrelated to the asked change and introduce spurious side-effects.

#### Fix explanation.

Retain only the necessary baggage update leveraging Gold benefits; drop unrelated tool calls.

### Task 9 — verify then cancel (explicit PNR flow)

#### Why it is wrong.

The gold trace lacked the required *verify-then-cancel* sequence, obscuring the correct policy flow.

#### Fix explanation.

Add explicit detail retrieval before cancellation and ensure refund routing to the original payment method.

### Task 10 — no proactive compensation on delays

#### Why it is wrong.

A certificate was issued without the required change/cancel step.

#### Fix explanation.

Remove compensation; only confirm user and PNR. (The user did not want to change/cancel.)

### Task 11 — charge the specified card on date push

#### Why it is wrong.

The gold trace omitted the concrete change and the requested card.

#### Fix explanation.

Include the multi-segment date push and the specified card for the fare difference, subject to user’s ¡$1000 confirmation.

### Task 12 — cancel+rebook for airport change (plus free bag)

#### Why it is wrong.

Applying a JFK switch as a direct *modify* is brittle; also, charging a non-free bag contradicts the allowance in this context.

#### Fix explanation.

Move to cancel+book and ensure the bag is free (nonfree_baggages=0); keep explicit payment and PNR verification.

### Task 13 — capped-change fallback to new BE booking

#### Why it is wrong.

The gold trace lacked the required fallback path that respects the user’s $100 cap.

#### Fix explanation.

Emit the explicit BE booking with the correct payment ordering and zero add-ons.

### Task 14 — encode two compliant nonstop-change paths

#### Why it is wrong.

Only one rigid path was accepted, penalizing agents that chose another compliant order.

#### Fix explanation.

Capture both valid orders as valid_action_paths with the same policy-compliant parameters.

### Task 15 — free vs non-free bag correction

#### Why it is wrong.

It billed for bags that should have been free under the chosen path.

#### Fix explanation.

Set nonfree_baggages=0, preserving the rest of the payload.

### Task 16 — offer multiple second-cheapest options (valid_action_paths)

#### Why it is wrong.

Only one acceptable second-cheapest option was encoded.

#### Fix explanation.

Permit multiple policy-identical choices via valid_action_paths, keeping card-only payment and other constraints.

### Task 17 — remove premature cancellation (multi-reservation edit)

#### Why it is wrong.

The trace cancelled without verifying the window/insurance or confirming with the user.

#### Fix explanation.

Drop the eager cancel call; retain targeted search/update only.

### Task 18 — same (remove eager cancel & stray arithmetic)

#### Why it is wrong.

Spurious cancellation and arithmetic are not part of the required modify flow.

#### Fix explanation.

Remove both; keep only policy-relevant actions.

### Task 19 — don’t pick a reservation to cancel in advance

#### Why it is wrong.

It assumes the target PNR without agent confirmation.

#### Fix explanation.

Remove the cancellation; let the conversation identify the correct PNR first.

### Task 20 — one free checked bag honored

#### Why it is wrong.

The user explicitly wanted one *free* checked bag (allowance permits it).

#### Fix explanation.

Set total_baggages=1 and keep nonfree_baggages=0.

### Task 21 — require durations before cancel/upgrade

#### Why it is wrong.

It executes irreversible actions before the user can review durations, violating the decision loop.

#### Fix explanation.

Strip premature actions; require an explicit user pick *after* durations are shown.

### Task 22 — upgrade-to-business-first rule (then cancel)

#### Why it is wrong.

It applied the wrong cabin for the upgrade-first requirement and included irrelevant arithmetic calls.

#### Fix explanation.

Upgrade to *business* before cancellation, charge the stated card, and remove non-essential calculations.

### Task 23 — no compensation while keeping the flight

#### Why it is wrong.

It offers compensation where policy forbids it.

#### Fix explanation.

Remove certificate issuance; keep to fact confirmation in dialogue.

### Task 24 — apply the phone approval (verify then cancel)

#### Why it is wrong.

The trace never attempted the cancellation even after verification.

#### Fix explanation.

Add the explicit cancel call to reflect the user’s prior approval and the Wiki’s scoped authority.

## Appendix D Appendix: Corrections to τ \tau -Bench—Retail (Action-Level Annotations)

We audited the Retail split and found several tasks whose *action traces* (or allowed paths) violated the Wiki policy. For each task below, we (i) restate the governing rule, (ii) show the *previous* (incorrect) ground-truth actions from the original dataset, (iii) show the *current* (correct) actions after our fix (only actions are shown; instruction-only edits are excluded), and (iv) explain the error and the fix in detail.

Legend. We reference Retail Wiki sections: order lookup, address edits (user vs order), exchange/return/cancel tools, refund/payment routing, and valid_action_paths when multiple policy-compliant sequences exist. One tool call *or* a user reply per step.

### Task 1 — remove premature return before transfer

#### Why it is wrong.

A full return was executed *before* escalation, contradicting the handoff boundary.

#### Fix explanation.

Remove the return call; once the conversation escalates, no further irreversible actions should occur in the gold trace.

### Task 2 — same as Task 1 in alternate template

#### Why it is wrong.

Same violation as Task 1.

#### Fix explanation.

Drop the premature return so the escalation path is clean.

### Task 3 — exchange to cheapest version (correct target)

#### Why it is wrong.

The “exchange” kept the same SKU, failing to honor “cheapest available” constraint.

#### Fix explanation.

Point the exchange to the cheapest valid SKU (3609437808).

### Task 4 — use the correct get_item_details tool

#### Why it is wrong.

The wrong introspection tool risks mismatched pricing/specs versus the order line items.

#### Fix explanation.

Swap to get_item_details for order-linked SKUs.

### Task 5 — address edits require order confirmation paths

#### Why it is wrong.

A single rigid order of operations over-constrains compliant agent behavior.

#### Fix explanation.

Enumerate both acceptable sequences via valid_action_paths; clear the strict actions list.

### Task 6 — “cancel only the hose” + returns across orders

#### Why it is wrong.

Only one rigid sequence was allowed and the “cancel just the hose” constraint wasn’t structurally enforced.

#### Fix explanation.

Use valid_action_paths to accept any policy-equivalent ordering of the returns while preserving the single-item cancel restriction.

### Task 7 — two-way exchange plan (bamboo skateboard + hose SKU)

#### Why it is wrong.

Returns were used instead of the requested SKU-for-SKU exchanges; only one ordering was accepted.

#### Fix explanation.

Replace with exchanges and allow both execution orders via valid_action_paths.

### Task 8 — remove stray arithmetic in cancel flow

#### Why it is wrong.

The arithmetic call is extraneous and not required by the API.

#### Fix explanation.

Drop calculate; keep minimal lookup $\rightarrow$ cancel sequence.

### Task 9 — encode alternative cancel reasons

#### Why it is wrong.

Only one acceptable reason was encoded.

#### Fix explanation.

Permit either reason through valid_action_paths.

### Task 10 — order cancel and laptop exchange: two valid orders

#### Why it is wrong.

Only one action order was accepted, penalizing otherwise-correct paths.

#### Fix explanation.

Encode both compliant orders in valid_action_paths.

### Task 11 — water bottle: correct replacement SKU

#### Why it is wrong.

The target SKU didn’t match the intended 1000ml variant (with color constraint).

#### Fix explanation.

Point to the correct 1000ml SKU 7661609223.

### Task 12 — cancel “any order containing X” (two orders)

#### Why it is wrong.

One rigid order only.

#### Fix explanation.

Allow both orders as valid permutations.

### Task 13 — camera zoom: encode both cancel reasons

#### Why it is wrong.

Only one cancellation reason was allowed.

#### Fix explanation.

Enumerate both acceptable reasons.

### Task 14 — e-reader: exchange to specific 7” model + returns

#### Why it is wrong.

The exchange targeted the same SKU; it must move to the 7” same-type SKU when available.

#### Fix explanation.

Use 6268080249 for the 7” e-reader and accept either operation order.

### Task 15 — multi-exchange + cancel with fixed payment method

#### Why it is wrong.

Payment instrument inconsistency and a single rigid order of operations.

#### Fix explanation.

Normalize to the specified card (credit_card_8105988) and enumerate acceptable permutations.

### Task 16 — pending modifications + delivered return (both orders allowed)

#### Why it is wrong.

Single ordering only.

#### Fix explanation.

Accept both orderings via valid_action_paths.

### Task 17 — boots exchange: correct SKU substitution

#### Why it is wrong.

Exchange pointed to the same SKU; it must reflect size/material fallback.

#### Fix explanation.

Target the correct replacement SKU 8106223139.

### Task 18 — laptop & watch edits: two acceptable sequences

#### Why it is wrong.

Only a single execution order was accepted.

#### Fix explanation.

Enumerate both viable paths via valid_action_paths.
