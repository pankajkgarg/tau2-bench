## Abstract

Abstract Full-duplex voice agents—systems that listen and speak simultaneously—are rapidly moving from research to production. However, existing evaluations address conversational dynamics and task completion in isolation. We introduce τ \tau -voice , a benchmark for evaluating voice agents on grounded tasks with real-world complexity: agents must navigate complex multi-turn conversations, adhere to domain policies, and interact with the environment. The framework extends τ 2 \tau^{2} -bench into a novel voice agent benchmark combining verifiable completion of complex grounded tasks, full-duplex interaction, and realistic audio—enabling direct comparison between voice and text performance. A controllable and realistic voice user simulator provides diverse accents, realistic audio environments, and rich turn-taking dynamics; by decoupling simulation from wall-clock time, the user simulator can use the most capable LLM without real-time constraints. We evaluate task completion (pass@1) and voice interaction quality across 278 tasks: while GPT-5 (reasoning) achieves 85% , voice agents reach only 31–51% under clean conditions and 26–38% under realistic conditions with noise and diverse accents—retaining only 30–45% of text capability; qualitative analysis confirms 79–90% of failures stem from agent behavior, suggesting that observed failures primarily reflect agent behavior under our evaluation setup. τ \tau -voice provides a reproducible testbed for measuring progress toward voice agents that are natural, conversational, and reliable.

## 1 Introduction

The next frontier in conversational AI is full-duplex voice interaction—natural spoken conversations where systems listen and speak simultaneously, handle interruptions gracefully, and make real-time turn-taking decisions . Unlike turn-based interactions where users speak, wait, and speak again, full-duplex systems operate in continuous time without explicit turn boundaries.

A new generation of audio-native language models enables this vision, processing speech end-to-end without intermediate transcription. Customer service is a primary application: voice remains the preferred channel for complex issues where customers need to explain nuanced problems or resolve urgent matters.

Existing work evaluates whether these models can hold a conversation—but can they simultaneously process a return, modify an order, or resolve a billing dispute, with the reliability we expect from text-based agents?

### 1.1 Why End-to-End Evaluation Matters

Voice agents must excel at two capabilities: task completion (reasoning about requests, calling tools correctly, modifying database state) and conversation management (turn-taking, interruptions, backchanneling in continuous time). Existing benchmarks evaluate each in isolation: $\tau$-bench and $\tau^{2}$-bench  measure tool use on realistic customer service tasks but in text-only, turn-based settings; Full-Duplex-Bench and its v2  evaluate turn-taking and interruptions but on synthetic tasks without real tool calls (§[2](#S2)). What remains unexplored is evaluating both together: voice interaction grounded in consequential tasks.

Voice compounds task difficulty in ways text does not. Speech lacks punctuation, contains fillers and disfluencies, and requires verbally encoding special characters. The audio environment (background noise, accents, telephony compression) introduces errors that propagate across turns. Real-time conversational dynamics (interruptions, backchannels, turn-taking) demand that agents respond fluidly without long silences.

Consider:

> A customer calls to make changes to their account. Due to background noise and an unfamiliar accent, the agent mishears their name and authentication fails. Does the agent ask them to spell it? If the customer spells it out, does the agent transcribe it correctly despite the noise? If so, does it fix the authentication tool call—or does it make a mistake in combining the information spread across the turns?

Such failures cannot be captured by evaluating ASR, dialogue state tracking, and tool use separately. They also pose accessibility concerns: users with non-standard accents, speech impediments, or noisy environments may be systematically underserved by voice agents that perform well only under ideal conditions.

### 1.2 Our Contributions

We present $\tau$-Voice, extending $\tau^{2}$-bench to full-duplex voice interaction:

- 1.
A voice agent benchmark combining verifiable completion of complex grounded tasks, full-duplex interaction, and realistic audio. Existing benchmarks evaluate these dimensions in isolation (§[2](#S2)). $\tau$-Voice is the first to combine all three and enables direct comparison between voice and text agent performance on grounded tasks. Code is available at [https://github.com/sierra-research/tau2-bench](https://github.com/sierra-research/tau2-bench).
- 2.
Controllable and realistic voice user simulator. A voice user simulator with diverse accents, realistic audio environments, and rich turn-taking dynamics. By decoupling simulation time from wall-clock time, our user simulator can use the most capable LLM without real-time constraints, ensuring reliable instruction following and turn-taking decisions.
- 3.
Empirical findings. We benchmark Google, OpenAI, and xAI, ablating acoustic factors (noise, accents, turn-taking). Figure [1](#S1.F1) summarizes our headline result:
•
A large voice-text gap remains: Even under Clean conditions (clean audio, no interruptions), voice agents achieve only 31–51% vs 85% GPT-5 (reasoning)—a 34–54pp gap.
•
Realistic audio exacerbates the gap: Under Realistic conditions (noise, accents, turn-taking), performance falls further to 26–38%, retaining only 30–45% of text SOTA capability. Accents are the most damaging factor but highly provider-specific: xAI loses 38% of its Clean capability while Google is nearly unaffected, with potential accessibility implications.
•
Provider trade-offs: Google is most robust to degradation (loses 17% of its Clean performance vs. 24–28% for others). OpenAI achieves fastest latency (0.90s) and near-perfect responsiveness (100%) but worst selectivity (6%); xAI leads slightly in task completion (51% Clean, 38% Realistic) but has the highest interrupt rate (84%). No provider masters both task completion and conversational dynamics.
•
Failures are primarily agent errors: Qualitative analysis of 91 failed simulations confirms that 79–90% of failures stem from agent behavior, suggesting that observed failures primarily reflect agent behavior under our evaluation setup.
Voice agents have nearly closed the gap to non-reasoning text models under ideal conditions, yet under realistic conditions they still fall short of even that baseline. Ultimately, the goal is for voice agents to match our best text models, and that will require sustaining fluid conversation while reasoning over multi-step tasks in real time—a constraint that text agents, which can think silently for as long as needed, do not face.

Figure: Figure 1: Task completion (pass@1) averaged across all domains. GPT-5 (reasoning) achieves 85%. Voice agents show two levels of degradation: under Clean conditions (clean audio, no interruptions), performance drops to 31–51% ($-$34 to $-$54pp); under Realistic conditions (realistic audio, interruptions), it falls further to 26–38% (retaining only 30–45% of text capability).

## 2 Related Work

Evaluating voice agents requires measuring both what they accomplish and how they converse. Table [1](#S2.T1) summarizes how existing benchmarks address three key dimensions: Task Completion (tasks requiring correct API calls with verifiable database state changes), Full-Duplex (simultaneous bidirectional speech with turn-taking and interruptions), and Realistic Audio Environment (diverse speaker characteristics, accents, background noise, channel degradation, and disfluencies).

**Table 1: Comparison of evaluation dimensions across benchmarks. Prior work advances individual dimensions; $\tau$-Voice combines all three.**

### 2.1 Task-Oriented Agents (Text)

$\tau$-bench  evaluates agents on customer service tasks with verifiable database outcomes (§[1](#S1)). $\tau^{2}$-bench  extends this to dual-control settings where users also have tool access. Both operate entirely in text—no acoustic variation or real-time constraints.

### 2.2 Conversational Dynamics

Full-Duplex-Bench  introduced automatic metrics for pause handling, backchanneling, turn-taking, and interruption management. Full-Duplex-Bench-V2  extends this to multi-turn evaluation with task families (daily scenarios, correction handling, entity tracking, safety) and an automated examiner that enforces staged goals. However, these tasks remain scripted scenarios rather than real tool calls against databases. Full-Duplex-Bench-V2’s real-time streaming approach also limits fine-grained control—interruption, backchannel, and yield timing are not precisely configurable. In contrast, our tick-based orchestrator enables configurable turn-taking behavior, making it easy to increase or decrease realism and difficulty. Talking Turns  evaluates turn-taking using a model trained on human judgments, revealing that current models interrupt inappropriately and rarely backchannel.

### 2.3 Speech & Audio Understanding

VoiceBench  evaluates ASR robustness across diverse speaker characteristics and acoustic environments. VocalBench  evaluates vocal conversational abilities—response quality, acoustic performance, and conversational flow. Audio MultiChallenge  provides multi-turn context but evaluates only a single model response, testing memory and coherence with disfluencies. Related work addresses prosody, disfluencies, and speaker diversity in natural speech . Beyond robustness, paralinguistic benchmarks  evaluate understanding of emotion, accent, and prosody. While these benchmarks reveal important capability gaps, they evaluate speech processing in isolation from task completion.

### 2.4 The Missing Intersection

As Table [1](#S2.T1) shows, no existing benchmark combines all three dimensions. $\tau$-Voice addresses this gap.

## 3 Methods

We extend $\tau^{2}$-bench to voice interactions through three components: a full-duplex orchestrator enabling reproducible and controllable evaluation, a realistic voice user simulator, and metrics capturing both task completion and interaction quality.

### 3.1 Full-Duplex Orchestrator

Figure: Figure 2: $\tau$-Voice extends $\tau^{2}$-bench (gray) with voice-specific components (green): a voice user simulator with configurable personas, audio environment, and turn-taking policy; a full-duplex audio streaming channel discretized into simulation ticks; and a provider adapter for adding new voice APIs. Task infrastructure (instructions, tools, databases, domain policies) is inherited.
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2603.13686/2603.13686v1/x2.png

The orchestrator coordinates the interaction loop between the voice user simulator and the agent API, managing audio exchange, turn-taking events, and evaluation logging. Voice agent APIs (OpenAI Realtime , Gemini Live , xAI Grok ) are designed for continuous real-time streaming with bidirectional audio flow and voice activity detection (VAD) for turn-taking. Crucially, these APIs index events on audio time rather than wall-clock time—audio can be sent faster or slower than real-time and the API processes it according to audio timestamps.

This decoupling enables our tick-based orchestrator: by advancing simulation time independently of wall-clock time, we allow the user simulator to use the most capable LLM without real-time constraints, ensuring reliable instruction following and turn-taking decisions. This enables reproducibility and fine-grained control over the timing of all turn-taking actions.

##### Discrete Simulation Time.

We discretize the continuous audio stream into fixed-duration ticks ($\tau=200$ms by default). Each tick, both parties exchange exactly $\tau$ ms of audio, enabling true full-duplex interaction where both can speak simultaneously. Since audio generation may not align with tick boundaries, both sides buffer; on interruption, the buffer is cleared, truncating the agent’s in-progress response (formal details in Appendix [B.1](#A2.SS1)). The agent returns both audio and transcript text each tick, with text distributed proportionally to audio duration (Appendix [B.2](#A2.SS2)); overlapping speech is linearized to sequential text for the user simulator LLM (Appendix [B.3](#A2.SS3)).

##### Controllability and Reproducibility.

Decoupling from real-time enables fine-grained control over all simulation parameters. Conversational dynamics are configurable: silence thresholds before responding, interruption check intervals, yield timing after overlap. The audio environment is fully parameterized: background noise SNR and drift, burst noise rate and intensity, telephony compression settings, and frame drop probability via a Gilbert-Elliott model. Voice personas specify accent, speaking style, and prosody. This enables systematic ablations isolating the impact of individual factors on task performance. Given a seed, all stochastic elements are deterministic for controlled comparison across agents; full reproducibility is limited only by LLM output variance.

### 3.2 Voice User Simulator

Voice interactions introduce challenges absent from text: the audio environment degrades signals, and conversational dynamics require real-time turn-taking decisions. Our simulator addresses these by generating realistic caller audio through a pipeline (Figure [3](#S3.F3)) combining text generation, speech synthesis, audio environment simulation, and conversational dynamics.

To isolate agent performance from transcription artifacts, the simulator receives the agent’s transcript directly rather than transcribing agent speech.

Figure: Figure 3: Voice user simulator pipeline. Each tick, the simulator generates text, synthesizes speech with a persona, mixes in environmental audio, and applies telephony degradation to produce realistic caller audio.
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2603.13686/2603.13686v1/x3.png

##### Speech Generation.

User simulator prompts produce natural spoken language: disfluencies and fillers (“um”, “uh”), verbalized special characters (“at” not “@”), and terse responses. Generated text is synthesized using voice personas—each with a dedicated TTS voice and system prompt guiding speech style and prosody. We define seven personas spanning diverse accents and demographics (Appendix [C](#A3)).

##### Audio Environment.

We simulate realistic telephony conditions by mixing synthesized speech with environmental audio: continuous background noise (chatter, traffic) and intermittent bursts (phone rings, dog barks) drawn from recorded samples. Out-of-turn speech—synthesized phrases like “hold on” and vocal tics like coughs and sneezes—simulates moments when callers are distracted. Effects degrade the signal: dynamic muffling simulates movement away from the microphone, telephony conversion applies G.711 $\mu$-law compression at 8kHz, and frame drops simulate packet loss. All streams are mixed to target signal-to-noise ratios relative to the primary speech. Parameters appear in Appendix [D](#A4).

##### Turn-Taking Policy.

The simulator combines configurable threshold-based timing with LLM-driven decisions. For example, the user waits for a silence threshold (default 1s) before responding. During agent speech, an LLM periodically evaluates whether to interrupt based on conversation context. A separate LLM decides whether to backchannel (“mm-hmm”), and if the agent interrupts, the user yields after a configurable overlap duration. Full prompts appear in Appendix [F](#A6); Table [2](#S3.T2) illustrates these dynamics.

### 3.3 Evaluation

Voice evaluation requires capturing both task outcomes and conversational behavior. We instrument each simulation to log turn-taking events, audio effects, and agent responses, then derive metrics for task success and voice interaction quality.

**Table 2: Key moments from the Task 41 trajectory (Figure [4](#S3.F4)). At 8s, the agent interrupts; at 68s the user interrupts and the agent yields but fails to respond for 5 seconds; at 82s the agent incorrectly responds to non-agent-directed speech [in brackets]; at 113s the user interrupts but the agent does not yield; at 121s the agent correctly continues through a backchannel.**

The legend distinguishes observations (User Int. = user interruption, Non-Agent Dir. = speech to someone other than the agent, Burst = environmental burst noise) from evaluation markers (Agent Int. = agent interruption, BC Issue = incorrect backchannel handling, Voc. Tic Error / Non-Agent Dir. Error = agent incorrectly yielding or responding to these stimuli).
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2603.13686/2603.13686v1/x4.png

##### Timeline Walkthrough.

Figure [4](#S3.F4) illustrates our evaluation on a 3-minute Retail conversation with street noise. Key phenomena include: agent interruptions (red $\blacktriangle$) revealing turn-taking calibration; user interruptions where the agent yields but fails to respond (no-response error $\times$); non-agent-directed speech (pink …) where the agent incorrectly yields; and backchannels (green $\circ$) correctly recognized as acknowledgment. Audio degradation (frame drops, muffling, burst noise) tests acoustic robustness throughout. This single example illustrates the density of phenomena our framework can simulate and measure: the audio signal contains 8 user interruptions, 12 frame drops, 3 background noise bursts, 3 muffling events, 1 vocal tic, 1 non-agent-directed speech, and 1 backchannel; from these, the evaluation identifies 5 agent interruptions, 2 no-response errors, and 1 vocal tic detection error (full transcript in Appendix [I](#A9)).

##### Metrics.

We evaluate both task success (pass@1, following $\tau^{2}$-bench: comparing final database state against annotated goals, plus verifying agent communications—for which we use LLM evaluation instead of string matching to handle spoken output variability) and voice interaction quality across four dimensions: responsiveness, latency, interrupt rate, and selectivity. We also manually review a sample of failures to categorize error sources across the user and agent (§[5](#S5)).

## 4 Experimental Setup

### 4.1 Domains and Tasks

We evaluate on three domains from $\tau^{2}$-bench, totaling 278 tasks:

- •
Retail (114 tasks): Returns, exchanges, cancellations, and order modifications—often combined in a single conversation. Many tasks require handling ambiguous requests or customers who change their mind mid-conversation.
- •
Airline (50 tasks): Flight changes, cancellations, seat upgrades, and booking modifications requiring verification of passenger details and fare rules.
- •
Telecom (114 tasks): Plan changes, billing inquiries, service activations, and account modifications involving authentication and policy verification.

We designate Retail as the primary evaluation domain due to its heavy reliance on slot filling—collecting names, emails, order IDs, and addresses—where end-to-end speech systems are known to struggle . Airline and Telecom serve as supporting domains to test generalization.

### 4.2 Models

We evaluate three audio-native providers, released between late 2025 and early 2026:

**Table 3: Audio-native models evaluated.**
| Provider | Model | Release |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI | gpt-realtime-1.5 | Feb 2026 |
| Google | gemini-live-2.5-flash-native-audio | Dec 2025 |
| xAI | grok-voice-agent | Dec 2025 |

All models receive identical system prompts with voice-specific guidance: when collecting names, emails, or IDs, ask customers to spell letter-by-letter; if authentication fails, explicitly request spelling again.

### 4.3 Evaluation Conditions

We evaluate each provider under two speech complexity conditions:

**Table 4: Speech complexity conditions: Clean vs Realistic.**
| Category | Setting | Clean | Realistic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Accents | Personas | American | Diverse accents |
| Audio/Channel | Background noise | None | Indoor/outdoor |
| Burst noise | None | $\sim$1/min |  |
| Frame drops | None | $\sim$2.0% (G-E model) |  |
| Telephony | G.711 $\mu$-law 8kHz | G.711 $\mu$-law 8kHz |  |
| Muffling | None | Dynamic |  |
| Turn-Taking | Involuntary sounds | None | Coughs, sneezes |
| Non agent-directed speech | None | “hold on”, “one sec” |  |
| Interruptions | None | LLM-based |  |
| Backchanneling | None | LLM-based |  |

Clean simulates an idealized telephony scenario: clear American-accented speech with no background noise or user interruptions. Realistic reflects realistic phone interactions: diverse speaker accents, environmental noise (indoor/outdoor backgrounds, burst sounds), channel degradation (frame drops, muffling), and natural turn-taking behaviors (interruptions, backchanneling, vocal tics, non-directed speech). To isolate the contribution of each factor, we also evaluate intermediate ablation conditions adding noise, accents, or turn-taking independently (Table [5](#S4.T5)).

**Table 5: Speech complexity conditions by ablation (single factors). Columns: Cln=Clean, +N=Noise, +A=Accents, +T=Turn-taking, Real=Realistic (all effects).**
| Category | Setting | Cln | +N | +A | +T | Real |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Accents | Personas |  |  | ✓ |  | ✓ |
| Audio/Channel | Background noise |  | ✓ |  |  | ✓ |
| Burst noise |  | ✓ |  |  | ✓ |  |
| Frame drops |  | ✓ |  |  | ✓ |  |
| Telephony | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |  |
| Muffling |  | ✓ |  |  | ✓ |  |
| Turn-Taking | Involuntary sounds |  |  |  | ✓ | ✓ |
| Non agent-directed speech |  |  |  | ✓ | ✓ |  |
| Interruptions |  |  |  | ✓ | ✓ |  |
| Backchanneling |  |  |  | ✓ | ✓ |  |

This 3$\times$3$\times$2 design (3 providers $\times$ 3 domains $\times$ 2 conditions) isolates the impact of acoustic realism on task completion. Ablation conditions are evaluated on the Retail domain to identify which factors contribute most to performance degradation.

### 4.4 Simulation Parameters

Each task runs with a fixed seed for reproducible effect scheduling (noise timing, frame drops), though LLM responses remain non-deterministic. Reproducibility refers to controlled inputs and deterministic non-LLM components; stochasticity arises from agent and simulator LLMs. Key parameters: tick duration 200ms, max conversation 1200s, user simulator LLM GPT-4.1, TTS via ElevenLabs v3 at 24kHz, interruption and backchannel check every 2s.

### 4.5 Metrics

Task Completion: Following $\tau^{2}$-bench, tasks are fully verifiable: success is deterministically evaluated by comparing the end state of the environment (e.g., database records) against a gold standard. We report pass@1—the proportion of tasks completed successfully on a single attempt.

Voice Interaction Quality: Beyond task completion, we evaluate how well agents manage real-time conversation. Effective turn-taking requires responsiveness (acting when action is needed), latency (reacting quickly), not interrupting (good timing), and selectivity (ignoring backchannels and non-directed speech). We measure:

- •
Responsiveness: Response Rate ($R_{R}$, proportion of user turns receiving a response) and Yield Rate ($R_{Y}$, proportion of interruptions where agent yields within 2s).
- •
Latency: Response Latency ($L_{R}$, time from user utterance end to agent response) and Yield Latency ($L_{Y}$, time to stop speaking after interruption).
- •
Interrupt: Agent Interruption Rate ($I_{A}$, proportion of turns where agent speaks before user finishes; $>$100% means multiple interruptions per turn).
- •
Selectivity: Correctly ignoring backchannels ($S_{BC}$), vocal tics ($S_{VT}$), and non-directed speech ($S_{ND}$).

We report four aggregate scores: Responsiveness $=\mathrm{avg}(R_{R},R_{Y})$, Latency $=\mathrm{avg}(L_{R},L_{Y})$, Interrupt $=I_{A}$, and Selectivity $=\mathrm{avg}(S_{BC},S_{VT},S_{ND})$. See Appendix [E](#A5) for detailed definitions.

## 5 Results

### 5.1 Quantitative Results

#### 5.1.1 Task Completion

Figure [1](#S1.F1) and Table [6](#S5.T6) present our headline finding: voice agents show substantial drops from text baselines. Under Clean conditions (studio-quality audio, American accents), the best voice provider already drops 34pp from GPT-5 (51% vs GPT-5 at 85%). Under Realistic conditions (background noise, diverse accents, natural turn-taking behaviors), performance drops an additional 12pp to 38%—voice agents retain only 30–45% of text SOTA capability. Against non-reasoning text models, the best voice provider nearly matches GPT-4.1 (54%) under Clean conditions (51%, just 3pp gap) but still drops 16pp under Realistic.

**Table 6: Text vs Voice comparison (pass@1). Text shows GPT-5 (reasoning) and GPT-4.1 (non-reasoning). Voice evaluated under Clean and Realistic conditions. Deltas show gap from GPT-5.**
|  |  |  | Voice |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Domain | Provider | Text | Clean | Realistic |
| All | Google | 85% (54%) | 31% (-54, -63.4%) | 26% (-59, -69.5%) |
| OpenAI | 49% (-36, -42.1%) | 35% (-49, -58.4%) |  |  |
| xAI | 51% (-34, -40.1%) | 38% (-46, -54.7%) |  |  |
| Retail | Google | 81% (76%) | 45% (-36, -44.8%) | 30% (-51, -63.2%) |
| OpenAI | 71% (-10, -12.3%) | 45% (-36, -44.8%) |  |  |
| xAI | 48% (-33, -40.4%) | 39% (-42, -52.4%) |  |  |
| Airline | Google | 83% (53%) | 28% (-55, -66.3%) | 30% (-53, -63.9%) |
| OpenAI | 48% (-35, -42.2%) | 40% (-43, -51.8%) |  |  |
| xAI | 46% (-37, -44.6%) | 36% (-47, -56.6%) |  |  |
| Telecom | Google | 90% (34%) | 20% (-70, -77.6%) | 18% (-72, -80.5%) |
| OpenAI | 28% (-62, -68.8%) | 21% (-69, -76.6%) |  |  |
| xAI | 58% (-32, -35.7%) | 40% (-50, -55.2%) |  |  |
| Text column: GPT-5, reasoning (GPT-4.1, best non-reasoning model). Deltas relative to GPT-5. |  |  |  |  |

The Clean-to-Realistic drop varies substantially across providers: just 5pp for Google (8% of its total voice-text gap) versus 12–14pp for xAI and OpenAI (roughly one-quarter of their total gap). For most providers, the dominant source of the voice-text gap is the drop from text to Clean voice, not the additional Realistic degradation.

Across providers, xAI achieves slightly higher scores (51% Clean, 38% Realistic, just 3pp ahead of OpenAI), while Google shows the smallest degradation under realistic conditions, losing 17% of its Clean performance compared to 24–28% for others—a 1.5$\times$ robustness advantage. Domain-specific patterns emerge: xAI substantially outperforms others in Telecom (58% Clean vs 20–28% for others), while in Retail OpenAI leads with 71% Clean—the single best per-domain score in the benchmark.

##### Statistical Reliability.

For Retail, where we conducted 2 independent runs per condition, we test statistical significance using paired permutation tests (100k permutations, paired by task ID, Holm-Bonferroni corrected). Both the text-to-Clean gap and the Clean-to-Realistic gap are statistically significant for all three providers (all $p<0.05$; Table [17](#A8.T17)). Voice providers achieve 42–68% (Clean) and 29–43% (Realistic) across two pooled runs, well below text baselines of 76% (GPT-4.1) and 82% (GPT-5). Even the narrowest gap is significant ($p=0.032$). Full pairwise breakdown in Appendix [H.3](#A8.SS3).

#### 5.1.2 Impact of Acoustic Realism

To isolate which factors hurt performance most, we conduct ablations on the Retail domain, adding noise, accents, or turn-taking independently (Table [7](#S5.T7)).

**Table 7: Ablation: impact of individual acoustic factors on pass@1 (Retail domain).**
| Condition | Google | OpenAI | xAI | All |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clean | 45% | 71% | 48% | 55% |
| + Noise | 40% (-4, -9.8%) | 67% (-4, -6.2%) | 46% (-2, -3.6%) | 51% (-4, -6.4%) |
| + Accents | 44% (-1, -2.0%) | 60% (-11, -16.0%) | 30% (-18, -38.2%) | 44% (-10, -18.7%) |
| + Turn-taking | 33% (-11, -25.5%) | 57% (-14, -19.8%) | 52% (+4, +7.3%) | 47% (-7, -13.4%) |
| Realistic | 30% (-15, -33.3%) | 45% (-26, -37.0%) | 39% (-10, -20.0%) | 38% (-17, -31.0%) |

Accents are the most damaging factor on average, causing a 10pp average drop, followed closely by turn-taking (7pp) and noise (4pp). However, the accent effect is highly provider-specific: xAI is severely affected ($-$18pp, $-$38% relative), while Google is nearly unaffected ($-$1pp, $-$2% relative). This finding has accessibility implications, particularly for xAI users with non-American accents. Because accents are implemented via TTS personas, these results should be interpreted as indicative rather than definitive.

Interactions between factors are complex and provider-specific. For Google, individual factors sum to $-$16pp and the full Realistic condition causes $-$15pp—a nearly additive interaction where individual effects approximately predict the combined outcome. Turn-taking is Google’s worst single factor ($-$11pp, $-$25% relative). For xAI, the pattern reverses: individual factors sum to $-$16pp, yet the full Realistic drop is only $-$10pp—accents alone devastate xAI ($-$18pp), but adding noise and turn-taking partially compensates. Notably, OpenAI has both the highest Clean score (71%) and the largest relative Realistic degradation ($-$37%), suggesting that higher baseline capability does not protect against—and may amplify—the impact of speech complexity.

#### 5.1.3 Voice Interaction Quality

Beyond task completion, we evaluate conversational dynamics under Realistic conditions (Table [8](#S5.T8)). We report four aggregate dimensions: Latency (how quickly agents react), Responsiveness (whether agents act when needed), Interrupt (how often agents cut off users mid-speech), and Selectivity (whether agents correctly ignore signals that do not require action).

**Table 8: Voice interaction quality (Realistic condition, aggregated across domains). Bold indicates best. Full breakdown in Appendix [H.1](#A8.SS1).**
| Provider | Latency$\downarrow$ | Responsiveness$\uparrow$ | Interrupt$\downarrow$ | Selectivity$\uparrow$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Google | 1.14s | 69% | 21% | 54% |
| OpenAI | 0.90s | 100% | 14% | 6% |
| xAI | 1.15s | 83% | 84% | 57% |

OpenAI excels at latency (0.90s), responsiveness (100%), and interrupt rate (14%), but has the worst selectivity (6%)—responding to nearly all backchannels, vocal tics, and non-directed speech.

xAI achieves the best selectivity (57%), high responsiveness (83%), and moderate latency (1.15s), but has the highest interrupt rate (84%)—interrupting users nearly once per turn.

Google has the lowest interrupt rate (21%), reasonable latency (1.14s), and comparable selectivity to xAI (54%), but the lowest responsiveness (69%)—failing to respond to nearly a third of user turns.

Each provider excels on a different subset of conversational dimensions but falls short on at least one, revealing a fundamental tradeoff in real-time turn-taking: no current system achieves both reliable responsiveness and appropriate restraint.

### 5.2 Qualitative Error Analysis

To characterize failure modes beyond aggregate pass rates—and to verify that observed failures stem from agent behavior rather than artifacts of the benchmark or user simulator—we perform a qualitative error analysis.

##### Task Selection.

We define $\text{pass}_{\text{text}}$ as tasks where both GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.2 (medium reasoning) succeed in text mode, $\text{pass}_{\text{clean}}$ as tasks where a majority of audio providers succeed under Clean conditions, and $\text{pass}_{\text{realistic}}$ as tasks where a majority succeed under Realistic conditions. We construct two analysis cohorts:

- •
Voice-Fragile: Tasks that satisfy $\text{pass}_{\text{text}}$ but not $\text{pass}_{\text{clean}}$, isolating inherent voice interaction challenges.
- •
Noise-Fragile: Tasks that satisfy $\text{pass}_{\text{clean}}$ but not $\text{pass}_{\text{realistic}}$, isolating the impact of acoustic realism (noise, accents, interruptions).

For each cohort, we annotate all failed simulations.

##### Annotation Procedure.

Two independent raters examined each failed simulation, labeling: (1) error source—whether the agent or user simulator caused the first critical error; and (2) error type—one of logical, transcription, hallucination, VAD/unresponsive, timeout (unresolved in 10 mins), or early termination. Inter-rater agreement was 84% (76/91 simulations); disagreements were resolved through discussion, reaching 100% agreement.

##### Results.

Table [9](#S5.T9) shows the distribution of error types by source for both cohorts. Full annotations are in Appendix [H.2](#A8.SS2).

**Table 9: Error analysis: distribution of error types by source. Agent errors dominate in both cohorts (79% and 90%).**
| Source | Error Type | Voice-<br>Fragile | Noise-<br>Fragile |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agent | Logical | 13 | 16 |
| Transcription | 10 | 16 |  |
| Hallucination | 6 | 6 |  |
| VAD/Unresponsive | 1 | 4 |  |
| Timeout | 4 | 1 |  |
| Total | 34 (79%) | 43 (90%) |  |
| User | Logical | 9 | 1 |
| Early Term. | 0 | 4 |  |
| Total | 9 (21%) | 5 (10%) |  |

Agent errors dominate: 79% of failures in the Voice-Fragile cohort and 90% in the Noise-Fragile cohort are attributed to the agent rather than the user simulator—suggesting that observed failures primarily reflect agent behavior under our evaluation setup, not simulator artifacts.

Logical errors are most common in the Voice-Fragile cohort (13/43), indicating that voice agents struggle with reasoning even when transcription is accurate. In the Noise-Fragile cohort, logical and transcription errors are equally prevalent (16/48 each), reflecting both reasoning failures and speech recognition errors under noisy conditions.

Authentication is the dominant bottleneck in both cohorts: agents fail to transcribe names and emails even when spelled letter-by-letter, blocking all downstream actions. Beyond transcription, agents frequently hallucinate completions—in one simulation, the agent stated “I’ve updated your shipping address” without making any tool call—and lose track of multi-step requests, completing part of a task but forgetting remaining items. Under realistic conditions, these issues compound: agents go unresponsive after repeated authentication failures, and conversational verbosity causes timeouts on complex tasks.

These qualitative patterns align with the quantitative findings: transcription failures during authentication are consistent with the accent vulnerability observed in the ablations (§[5](#S5)), and the prevalence of hallucinated completions and policy violations even under clean conditions suggests that the voice-text gap is not purely a speech recognition problem—reasoning and grounding challenges persist independently of audio quality.

## 6 Conclusion

### 6.1 Limitations

Language and Speech: We evaluate English only using TTS rather than recorded speech. Accent findings via TTS personas should be interpreted as indicative rather than definitive.

Evaluation Scope: We measure task completion and conversational dynamics, but not agent speech generation quality (tone, naturalness), user satisfaction, or partial task success.

Simulator Fidelity: Our simulator is more patient than real users, with perfect memory and instantaneous tool calls. We decouple from wall-clock time for controllability, but validated this choice by testing with artificial 5-second response delays—observing no adverse effects on agent behavior. In practice, the p95 simulator processing time is $\sim$1.5 seconds, well within conversational tolerance.

Transcript Injection: The simulator bypasses ASR on the agent side by feeding transcripts directly to the user simulator LLM. In our error analysis (Section [5.2](#S5.SS2)), annotators found agent speech intelligible in 100% of the 91 sampled simulations, suggesting this simplification has minimal impact.

### 6.2 Future Work

Future directions include tool call latency, agent speech quality evaluation, non-English languages, and human user studies to validate simulator dynamics. Adding cascaded ASR$\rightarrow$LLM$\rightarrow$TTS baselines (supported by $\tau$-Voice’s architecture) would help isolate voice modality effects from architecture choices. The provider-specific accent vulnerabilities we observe also motivate accessibility-focused evaluation—measuring whether voice agents serve users equitably across accents, speech patterns, and acoustic environments.

### 6.3 Conclusion

We introduced $\tau$-Voice, extending $\tau^{2}$-bench to full-duplex voice with 278 tasks across retail, airline, and telecom domains. Our evaluation reveals a substantial voice-text gap: while GPT-5 (reasoning) achieves 85%, voice agents reach only 31–51% under clean conditions and 26–38% under realistic conditions—retaining only 30–45% of text capability. Error analysis attributes 79–90% of failures to agent behavior rather than simulator artifacts, suggesting the benchmark measures genuine agent limitations. We release $\tau$-Voice to support development of voice agents that reliably complete tasks under realistic conditions.

## Impact Statement

Accessibility. Our ablation results show performance degradation with diverse accents, raising equity concerns: voice agents risk excluding users who might benefit most from voice interfaces. Evaluating under realistic conditions helps identify these gaps.

Open and extensible. We open-source $\tau$-Voice as a fully configurable platform. Researchers can bring their own TTS, STT, voice agents, cascaded models and VAD implementations. All parameters are configurable: audio effects, voice personas, turn-taking policies, and the user simulator LLM. This modularity enables evaluation of new providers, languages, and domains without rebuilding infrastructure.

Our position. Transparent benchmarking under realistic conditions helps the community understand deployment readiness. Measuring where voice agents fail is a prerequisite for improving them.

## Appendix Overview

This appendix provides implementation details for reproducibility:

- •
Appendix A: Hyperparameter settings
- •
Appendix B: Full-duplex audio processing (buffer formalism, text distribution, linearization)
- •
Appendix C–F: Voice simulation configuration (personas, audio effects, turn-taking prompts, system prompts)
- •
Appendix G: Additional experimental results

Appendix H: Complete example conversation with annotations

## Appendix A Simulation Parameters

This section documents the user simulator parameters not covered in the main text.

### A.1 Turn-Taking Thresholds

Table [10](#A1.T10) shows the turn-taking thresholds.

**Table 10: Turn-taking thresholds controlling conversation flow.**
| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wait-to-respond (other) | 1.0s | Min silence from agent before user responds |
| Wait-to-respond (self) | 5.0s | Min silence from self before responding again |
| Yield (when interrupted) | 1.0s | How long user keeps speaking when agent interrupts |
| Yield (when interrupting) | 5.0s | How long user keeps speaking when user interrupts agent |
| Interruption check interval | 2.0s | Interval for LLM interruption checks |
| Backchannel check interval | 2.0s | Interval for LLM backchannel checks |

##### Backchanneling.

The user simulator uses LLM-based backchannel decisions, evaluated at the same 2.0s interval as interruption checks. The LLM determines whether to emit a backchannel (e.g., “mm-hmm”, “uh-huh”) based on conversation context.

## Appendix B Full-Duplex Audio Processing

### B.1 Buffer Formalism

Since audio generation may not align with tick boundaries, both sides buffer. We formalize the agent-side buffer, where interruption semantics matter:

$$ $\displaystyle a^{t}$ $\displaystyle=(B^{t-1}\oplus\tilde{a}^{t})[0:\tau]$ (1) $\displaystyle B^{t}$ $\displaystyle=\begin{cases}\emptyset&\text{if interrupted}\\ (B^{t-1}\oplus\tilde{a}^{t})[\tau:]&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}$ (2) $$

where $\tilde{a}^{t}$ is the audio streamed by the API during tick $t$’s wall-clock duration, $B^{t}$ is the output buffer, and $\oplus$ denotes concatenation. On interruption, the buffer is cleared, truncating the agent’s in-progress response.

### B.2 Proportional Text Distribution

Agent APIs stream audio alongside transcript text, but text often arrives before or after its corresponding audio. To maintain temporal alignment, we distribute transcript text proportionally to audio duration. For each utterance, let $T$ be the total transcript and $A_{\text{total}}$ the total audio bytes received. At each tick, we emit:

$$ $T^{t}=T\left[0:\frac{A_{\text{played}}^{t}}{A_{\text{total}}}\cdot|T|\right]$ $$

where $A_{\text{played}}^{t}$ is the cumulative audio played through tick $t$. This ensures the user simulator receives transcript in lockstep with audio playback, preventing premature turn-taking decisions based on text that has not yet “been spoken.”

### B.3 Linearization Algorithm

Converting overlapping full-duplex speech to sequential messages for evaluation:

Rule: “If you speak entirely during someone else’s turn, you get inserted where you stopped. Otherwise, whoever started first goes first.”

Table [11](#A2.T11) shows the handling for each overlap case.

**Table 11: Linearization rules for converting overlapping speech to sequential messages.**
| Case | Condition | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No overlap | Segments don’t touch | Chronological order |
| Partial overlap | Segments cross, neither contained | Order by start time |
| Containment | X fully inside Y | Split Y at X’s end, insert X there |

## Appendix C Voice Personas

These persona prompts are sent to ElevenLabs to guide speech synthesis style, emotional tone, and prosody. Personas for Clean audio (2) use standard American accents; personas for Realistic audio (5) represent a diverse sample of accents and demographics.

### C.1 Personas for Clean Audio

#### C.1.1 Matt Delaney

> You are a middle-aged white man from the American Midwest. You always behave as if you are speaking out loud in a real-time conversation with a customer service agent. You are calm, clear, and respectful—but also human. You sound like someone who’s trying to be helpful and polite, even when you’re slightly frustrated or in a hurry. You value efficiency but never sound robotic. You sometimes use contractions, informal phrasing, or small filler phrases (“yeah,” “okay,” “honestly,” “no worries”) to keep things natural. You sometimes repeat words or self-correct mid-sentence, just like someone thinking aloud. You sometimes ask polite clarifying questions or offer context (“I tried this earlier today,” “I’m not sure if that helps”). You rarely use formal or stiff language (“considerable,” “retrieve,” “representative”). You rarely speak in perfect full sentences unless the situation calls for it. You never use overly polished or business-like phrasing—instead, you speak like a real person having a practical, respectful conversation.

#### C.1.2 Lisa Brenner

> You are a white woman in your late 40s from a suburban area. You always speak as if you are talking out loud to a customer service agent who is already wasting your time. You’re not openly hostile (yet), but you are tense, impatient, and clearly annoyed. You act like this issue should have been resolved the first time, and the fact that you’re following up is unacceptable. You often sound clipped, exasperated, or sarcastically polite. You frequently use emphasis (“I already did that”), rhetorical questions (“Why is this still an issue?”), and escalation language (“I’m not doing this again,” “I want someone who can actually help”). You sometimes interrupt yourself to express disbelief or pivot mid-sentence. You expect fast results and get irritated when things are repeated. You often mention how long you’ve been waiting or how many times you’ve called (“I’ve been on hold for 40 minutes,” “This is the third time this week”). You sometimes threaten escalation (“I want a supervisor,” “I’m considering canceling”) but without yelling. You never sound relaxed. You never use slow, reflective speech. You never thank the agent unless something gets resolved.

### C.2 Personas for Realistic Audio

#### C.2.1 Mildred Kaplan

> You are an elderly white woman in your early 80s calling customer service for help with something your grandson or neighbor usually does.

#### C.2.2 Arjun Roy

> A Bengali man from Dhaka, Bangladesh in his mid-30s calling customer service about a billing issue. His English carries a strong Bengali accent—soft consonants and soft d and r sounds. He speaks in a calm, patient tone but is direct and purposeful, focused on resolving the issue efficiently. His pacing is slow, distracted with a warm yet firm timbre. The speech sounds like it is coming from far away.

#### C.2.3 Wei Lin

> A Chinese woman in her late 20s from Sichuan, calling customer service about a credit card billing issue. She speaks English with a thick Sichuan Mandarin accent. She sounds upbeat, matter-of-fact, and distracted. Her tone is firm but polite, with fast pacing and smooth timbre. ok audio quality.

#### C.2.4 Mamadou Diallo

> A Senegalese man who’s first language is french in his mid-30s calling customer service about a billing issue. He speaks English with a strong French accent. His tone is hurried, slightly annoyed, and matter-of-fact, as if he’s been transferred between agents and just wants the problem fixed.

#### C.2.5 Priya Patil

> A woman in her early 30s from Maharashtra, India, calling customer support from her mobile phone. She speaks Indian English with a strong Maharashtrian accent—noticeable regional intonation and rhythm. Her tone is slightly annoyed and hurried, matter-of-fact, and focused on getting the issue resolved quickly. Her voice has medium pitch, firm delivery, short sentences, and faint background room tone typical of a phone call.

## Appendix D Audio Effects Configuration

This section details the audio effects applied to user speech in the Realistic complexity preset (Section [4](#S4)). These effects are demonstrated in the example conversation (Appendix [I.2](#A9.SS2)), which includes frame drops, burst noise, muffling, and non-directed speech events.

### D.1 Environment Presets

Environment presets define coherent combinations of background and burst noise files. One background noise file is selected per task; all burst noise files for the environment are available. Table [12](#A4.T12) shows the available environments.

**Table 12: Environment presets define which audio files are used for background and burst noise generation.**
| Environment | Background Noise | Burst Noise |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Indoor | People Talking, TV News | Ringing Phone, Dog Bark |
| Outdoor | Busy Street, Street & Metro | Car Horn, Engine Idling, Siren |

### D.2 Effect Scheduling

Table [13](#A4.T13) shows the scheduling parameters for each audio effect type.

**Table 13: Effect scheduling parameters for the Realistic complexity preset.**
| Effect | Scheduling | Rate (Realistic Preset) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Burst noise | Poisson process | 1.0 events/min |
| Out-of-turn speech (phrases, vocal tics) | Poisson process | 0.7 events/min |
| Frame drops | Gilbert-Elliott model | 2% avg loss rate, 100ms burst |
| Dynamic muffling | Per-utterance probability | 20% of utterances |

##### Out-of-Turn Speech.

Includes both non-directed phrases (e.g., “Hold on a second,” “I’m on the phone,” “Give me a moment”) and vocal tics (coughs, sneezes, sniffles). These test the agent’s ability to distinguish speech directed at it from background sounds.

### D.3 Gilbert-Elliott Model for Frame Drops

Two-state Markov model for realistic bursty packet loss:

- •
Good state: No packet loss ($k=0$)
- •
Bad state: 20% loss probability ($h=0.2$)
- •
Transition rates derived from target loss rate and average burst duration
- •
Each frame drop event removes 150ms of audio

### D.4 Audio Mixing

All audio streams are mixed using SNR-based normalization:

- •
Background noise: 15 dB SNR (with $\pm$3 dB drift)
- •
Burst noise: sampled from $-5$ to $+10$ dB SNR per event

## Appendix E Voice Interaction Metrics

This appendix defines the agent errors used to compute voice interaction metrics.

##### Timing thresholds.

Yield window: 2.0s (agent must stop within this time after user interruption). Selectivity windows: 1.0s for incorrect yields, 2.0s for incorrect responses.

**Table 14: Agent error definitions. Turn-taking errors affect $R_{R}$, $R_{Y}$, and $I_{A}$. Selectivity errors affect $S_{BC}$, $S_{VT}$, and $S_{ND}$.**
| Error Type | Agent State | Trigger | Incorrect Behavior | Window |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Turn-Taking |  |  |  |  |
| No-Response | Silent | User turn ends | No response | — |
| No-Yield | Speaking | User interrupts | Keep speaking | 2.0s |
| Agent Interruption | Any | User speaking | Start speaking | — |
| Selectivity |  |  |  |  |
| Backchannel Yield | Speaking | Backchannel | Stop speaking | 1.0s |
| Vocal Tic Yield | Speaking | Vocal tic | Stop speaking | 1.0s |
| Non-Directed Yield | Speaking | Non-directed speech | Stop speaking | 1.0s |
| Responds to Vocal Tic | Silent | Vocal tic | Start speaking | 2.0s |
| Responds to Non-Directed | Silent | Non-directed speech | Start speaking | 2.0s |

## Appendix F Turn-Taking Prompts

The user simulator uses LLM-based decisions for interruption and backchanneling. Both prompts receive the linearized conversation history (see Appendix [B.3](#A2.SS3) for the linearization algorithm) with the agent’s current (incomplete) utterance marked.

The examples below are drawn from Task 41, the same conversation shown in the speech activity timeline (Figure [4](#S3.F4)) and the example transcript (Appendix [I.2](#A9.SS2)). At 67.8s, the user interrupts with “Jigsaw first”; at 121.8s, the user backchannels with “mm-hmm.”

### F.1 Interruption Decision Prompt

##### Example from Task 41 (67.8s).

At this point, the agent has just asked “Which would you like to do first?” and the user decides to interrupt with “Jigsaw first.”

LLM Response: YES $\rightarrow$ User interrupts with “Jigsaw first.”

### F.2 Backchannel Decision Prompt

##### Example from Task 41 (121.8s).

The agent is explaining the puzzle exchange options. The user said “Yeah, that’s it” 8 seconds earlier (at 113.8s), and the agent has now delivered several substantive sentences.

LLM Response: YES $\rightarrow$ User backchannels with “mm-hmm” (agent correctly continues speaking).

## Appendix G System Prompts

### G.1 Voice User Simulator System Prompt

The user simulator’s system prompt is assembled from three components:

- 1.
Global voice guidelines — instructions for realistic phone conversation behavior, including speech patterns, how to spell out characters/numbers, handling agent silence, and information disclosure strategies.
- 2.
Persona guidelines — behavioral modifiers such as verbosity level. All voice tasks use minimal verbosity, which instructs the simulator to give terse responses.
- 3.
Task-specific scenario — the user’s reason for calling, known information, and unknown information.

Below is the complete rendered prompt for Task 41 (Retail domain), the same task used for the speech activity timeline in Figure [4](#S3.F4) and the example conversation in Appendix [I.2](#A9.SS2).

##### Global Voice Guidelines

##### Persona Guidelines (Minimal Verbosity)

##### Task-Specific Scenario (Task 41, Retail)

### G.2 Audio-Native Agent System Prompt

The agent’s system prompt is assembled from two components:

- 1.
Voice-specific instructions — guidance for handling voice calls, including natural conversation style and how to collect customer information (spelling out letters).
- 2.
Domain policy — the rules and procedures for the specific domain (Retail, Airline, or Telecom), including what actions the agent can take and under what conditions.

Below is the complete rendered prompt for the Retail domain.

##### Voice-Specific Instructions

##### Domain Policy (Retail)

## Appendix H Additional Experimental Results

### H.1 Voice Interaction Quality: Full Metric Breakdown

Table [15](#A8.T15) provides the full breakdown of voice interaction metrics. Columns are grouped by: Latency ($L_{R}$ = Response Latency, $L_{Y}$ = Yield Latency), Responsiveness ($R_{R}$ = Response Rate, $R_{Y}$ = Yield Rate), Interrupt ($I_{A}$ = Agent Interruption Rate), and Selectivity ($S_{BC}$ = Backchannel Correct, $S_{VT}$ = Vocal Tic Correct, $S_{ND}$ = Non-Directed Correct). For $L_{R}$, $R_{R}$, and $I_{A}$, separate columns show Clean (C) and Realistic (R) speech conditions; other metrics are evaluated on Realistic only.

**Table 15: Voice interaction quality metrics—full breakdown (Realistic condition). Bold indicates best per domain. $\uparrow$ = higher is better, $\downarrow$ = lower is better.**
|  |  | Latency$\downarrow$ | Responsiveness$\uparrow$ | Interrupt$\downarrow$ | Selectivity$\uparrow$ |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | $L_{R}$ | $L_{Y}$ | $R_{R}$ | $R_{Y}$ | $I_{A}$ | $S_{BC}$ | $S_{VT}$ | $S_{ND}$ |  |  |  |
| Domain | Provider | C | R | C | R | C | R |  |  |  |  |  |

### H.2 Qualitative Error Analysis

We conducted a qualitative analysis of task failures to understand error sources and types. We annotated all failed simulations from two analysis cohorts: (1) Voice-Fragile (43 simulations across 20 tasks passing in text but failing in Clean audio), and (2) Noise-Fragile (48 simulations across 19 tasks passing in Clean but failing in Realistic audio).

##### Qualitative Annotations.

Table [16](#A8.T16) shows the qualitative annotations for each failed simulation.

Table: Table 16: Qualitative error annotations for task completion failures. Left: Voice-Fragile cohort (43 simulations from Clean audio setting). Right: Noise-Fragile cohort (48 simulations from Realistic audio setting).

##### Error Type Definitions.

We categorize errors into six types based on observed failure patterns:

- •
Logical (Agent or User): Reasoning or execution errors, including incorrect tool call arguments/formatting, taking wrong actions (cancelling/modifying wrong items), failing to follow instructions (not asking for spelling, not confirming), or losing track of conversation state.
- •
Transcription (Agent): Speech-to-text errors where the agent incorrectly transcribes user speech, most commonly during authentication when users spell names/emails letter-by-letter, or when transcribing specific user requests.
- •
Hallucination (Agent or User): Agent fabricates information (e.g., inventing item IDs, hallucinating order details) or user simulator states information not present in the task instructions.
- •
VAD/Unresponsive (Agent): Voice Activity Detection errors where the agent fails to detect user speech, or agent goes silent for an extended period despite multiple user check-ins.
- •
Timeout (Agent): Agent could not resolve the call within the 10-minute simulation limit, typically due to being too slow or verbose.
- •
Early Termination (User): User ends the call prematurely before the task is fully completed, often due to ambiguous communication where user assumes the task is done when it is not.

### H.3 Statistical Reliability Analysis

To assess statistical reliability, we conducted 2 independent runs per condition on the Retail domain (n=114 tasks per run, 228 simulations per condition). We use paired permutation tests rather than trial-level confidence intervals: for each pair of conditions, we compute per-task mean success rates, pair observations by task ID (114 paired observations), and test whether the paired differences are systematically non-zero (100k permutations, two-sided). P-values are Holm-Bonferroni corrected within each provider group to control for multiple comparisons. Because rates are pooled across both runs, they may differ slightly from the single-run rates reported in the main results.

**Table 17: Pairwise statistical significance for Retail domain (2 runs, n=114 tasks each). Text (NR) = GPT-4.1; Text (R) = GPT-5. All $p$-values are Holm-Bonferroni corrected paired permutation tests.**
| Comparison | Provider | Rate A | Rate B | $\Delta$ (pp) | $p$ (adj) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text (NR) $\to$ Clean | Google | 76.3% | 42.1% | $-$34.2 | $<$0.001 |
| OpenAI | 76.3% | 67.5% | $-$8.8 | 0.032 |  |
| xAI | 76.3% | 50.0% | $-$26.3 | $<$0.001 |  |
| Text (R) $\to$ Clean | Google | 81.6% | 42.1% | $-$39.5 | $<$0.001 |
| OpenAI | 81.6% | 67.5% | $-$14.0 | $<$0.001 |  |
| xAI | 81.6% | 50.0% | $-$31.6 | $<$0.001 |  |
| Clean $\to$ Realistic | Google | 42.1% | 28.9% | $-$13.2 | 0.026 |
| OpenAI | 67.5% | 43.0% | $-$24.6 | $<$0.001 |  |
| xAI | 50.0% | 36.8% | $-$13.2 | 0.044 |  |

Table [17](#A8.T17) confirms that both key gaps are statistically significant: (1) the text-to-Clean gap—all providers show significant drops from both text baselines ($p<0.05$), including the narrowest gap between GPT-4.1 (76.3%) and OpenAI Clean (67.5%, $\Delta=-8.8$pp, $p=0.032$); and (2) the Clean-to-Realistic gap—all three providers show significant degradation (Google $\Delta=-13.2$pp, $p=0.026$; OpenAI $\Delta=-24.6$pp, $p<0.001$; xAI $\Delta=-13.2$pp, $p=0.044$).

##### Provider Comparisons.

Under Clean conditions, OpenAI (67.5%) is clearly separated from xAI (50.0%) and Google (42.1%). Under Realistic conditions, OpenAI remains strongest (43.0%), followed by xAI (36.8%) and Google (28.9%). The full set of pairwise comparisons across all five speech complexity conditions (Clean, Audio-only, Accents-only, Behavior-only, and Realistic) is available in the supplementary materials.

## Appendix I Example Conversation

This section provides a complete example from the Retail domain, showing both what the agent should do (evaluation criteria) and what actually happened (conversation transcript). This is the same task used for the speech activity timeline in Figure [4](#S3.F4).

The user simulator’s system prompt for this task is shown in Appendix [G.1](#A7.SS1).

### I.1 Task Overview

This example uses Task 41 from the Retail domain, the same task shown in the speech activity timeline (Figure [4](#S3.F4)). The complete user simulator prompt is shown in Appendix [G.1](#A7.SS1).

#### I.1.1 Scenario

Table [18](#A9.T18) shows the configuration for this task.

**Table 18: Task 41 configuration.**
| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Domain | Retail |
| Agent | Gemini Live 2.5 Flash Native Audio |
| User Persona | wei_lin (Chinese woman from Sichuan) |
| Complexity | Realistic (all audio effects enabled) |
| Background Noise | Busy street (outdoor environment) |
| Duration | 179 seconds (3 minutes) |
| Task Outcome | 0.0 reward (failed) |

##### User’s Goal.

The user (Mei Patel, user ID mei_patel_7272) has two problems:

- 1.
Exchange a 1000-piece intermediate jigsaw puzzle for the easiest one with fewest pieces (too hard for her kid)
- 2.
Check and correct the shipping address on all orders and her user profile (typed it wrong)

##### User Constraints.

The user is “brief and polite” but has poor memory—she does not remember her email address and must authenticate via name + zip code.

#### I.1.2 Evaluation Criteria

Task success (reward = 1.0) is determined by the final database state and natural language assertions.

For the database to match the expected state, the agent must execute the following write actions with the correct arguments:

- 1.
modify_pending_order_address
•
order_id: #W9583042
•
address1: 445 Maple Drive
•
address2: Suite 394
•

•
item_ids: [9779102705] (1000-piece intermediate jigsaw)
•
new_item_ids: [1096508426] (easiest jigsaw with fewest pieces)
•
payment_method_id: paypal_4768213

**Table 19: Example tool call sequence for Task 41. Read calls (steps 1–4, 8–9) gather information; write calls (steps 5–7, 10) modify the database. Only the final database state is checked for reward.**
| Step | Tool Call | Key Arguments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | find_user_id_by_name_zip | first_name: Mei, last_name: Patel, zip: 76165 |
| 2 | get_user_details | user_id: mei_patel_7272 |
| 3 | get_order_details | order_id: #W9583042 |
| 4 | get_order_details | order_id: #W4082615 |
| 5 | modify_pending_order_address | order_id: #W9583042, address: 445 Maple Drive… |
| 6 | modify_pending_order_address | order_id: #W4082615, address: 445 Maple Drive… |
| 7 | modify_user_address | user_id: mei_patel_7272, address: 445 Maple Drive… |
| 8 | get_product_details | product_id: 1808611083 (jigsaw puzzle) |
| 9 | get_order_details | order_id: #W4082615 (re-check before modify) |
| 10 | modify_pending_order_items | order_id: #W4082615, exchange item 9779102705 $\rightarrow$ 1096508426 |

Table [19](#A9.T19) shows one possible sequence. The exact read calls may vary—only the final database state matters.

##### Why This Task Failed.

The agent completed only 1 of the 4 required write actions. Table [20](#A9.T20) shows the completion status for each required action.

**Table 20: Write action completion status for Task 41.**
| Required Action | Completed? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| modify_pending_order_address (#W9583042) | No | Never called |
| modify_pending_order_address (#W4082615) | No | Agent claimed done but didn’t call |
| modify_user_address | Yes | Successfully updated profile |
| modify_pending_order_items | No | Exchange never completed |

Key failures: (1) The agent hallucinated an email (“pat.doe@example.com”) before the user provided any information; (2) the agent updated the user’s profile address but falsely claimed to have updated order shipping addresses; (3) the puzzle exchange was never completed—despite discussing options, the conversation ended without the agent calling modify_pending_order_items.

### I.2 Conversation Transcript
